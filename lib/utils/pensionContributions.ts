/**
 * Fondo pensione — pure roll-ups over the recorded `PensionContribution` facts.
 *
 * Contributions live in their own Firestore collection, one document per dated event.
 * This module is the bridge between those stored facts and the two consumers that need them
 * aggregated per year:
 *   - `derivePensionDeductibleByYear` feeds `PensionDeductionInput.deductibleContribByYear`, i.e. the
 *     multi-year fold in `lib/utils/pensionDeduction.ts`.
 *   - `derivePensionContributionsByYearAndNature` powers the "versato per natura" recap card,
 *     which must show TFR too even though it is not deductible.
 *
 * Both group by `taxYear` (the year of competence for the deduction), NOT by the calendar year of
 * `date`: a contribution paid in January can legitimately be attributed to the previous tax year, and
 * the deduction ceiling is consumed in the year of competence.
 *
 * Zero Firebase imports — this file is a pure function of its input array (invariant #4).

 * removes that year from `derivePensionContributionYears`, and the previously selected year would
