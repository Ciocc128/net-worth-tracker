/**
 * Category matching across expense types.
 *
 * Categories are scoped to a type: ExpenseDialog only offers the ones whose `type`
 * matches the selected one. Changing the type of an already-saved expense therefore
 * always invalidates the current selection — mechanically correct, and annoying, because
 * the most common reason to change the type is that the row was filed under the wrong
 * one of two same-named categories ("Casa" as a fixed expense when it was a variable
 * one). This finds the equivalent category under the target type so the form can land
 * the user where they were already going.

 * Find the category with the same name under `targetType`.

 * Name comparison is case-insensitive and trimmed, matching the only other name
 * comparison in the taxonomy (CategoryManagementDialog's duplicate-subcategory guard).
 *
 * The subcategory follows only if its name also matches inside the category we landed
 * on. A partial match is not a failure: keeping the category and dropping the
 * subcategory is strictly better than sending the user back to an empty form.
 *
 * @returns null when nothing matches, so the caller can clear the selection as before.
